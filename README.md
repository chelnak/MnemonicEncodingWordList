## About

```mnemonics.json``` provides versioned datasource for mnemonic words.

### Now:
- Host mnemonics.json to provide a source where mnemonic words can be easily retrieved.
- Host ```Get-MnemonicWord.ps1```. The idea behind this function is to retrieve a random word from the hosted list.

### Next:
- Port the origional c library to PowerShell
